# NY Times News Reader Take-Home Challenge

## Abstract
This project was an 8 hour timed coding challenge designed to pull articles from the NYT top stories API, and providing a user a list of articles, a detailed view of each article, a link to the real NYT article, as well as a sort/filter/search functionality.  This challenge was given to demonstrate a strong understanding of React JS and FE best practices and an ability to prioritize for an MVP due to the time limit.
